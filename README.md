# What-to-watch
What to Watch is an app that allows you to see movie showings in your area and generates movie suggestions based on genre interests. A user can see what's playing in theatres if they feel like going out or get a suggestion for an already released movie if they feel like staying in. The movie suggestion function has different genres and uses IMDB ratings to make sure it always gives a suggestion with a high rating to ensure the film will be enjoyable to watch. WTW utilizes IMDB, OMDB and leaflet APIs to generate suggestions, populate movie screen times and locations.
