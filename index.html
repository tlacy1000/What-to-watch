  <h2>Our history</h2>
  <p>Lacy is obsessed with horror movies (especially the terrible/campy ones). Her favprite director is Rob Zombie. 
    Her sister Daphne, who also loves scary movies, messaged Lacy to tell her she should go see the new Rob Zombie movie that just came out. 
    When Lacy tried to get tickets, she discovered that it was only playing for 3 days, and her sister had told her on the third day.
    The only theatres that were showing it were playing it at 7 pm- and Lacy wasn't free until 8 pm.
    So, what's a girl to do? She decided she'd wait for it to release on a streaming service, but in the meantime- why not watch something else at home? Thus, "Movie Time"
    was born! Utilizing a few movie database and showtime APIs, the team built a web app that will show you new movies currently in theatres (if you feel like going out) and good
    films that have already been released if you feel like staying in. Simply tell it what genre you like, and boom! Friday night plans made!
